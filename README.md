# `UPDATE 2025-06-17: Updates to the block_sf(), blockgroup_sf(), tract_sf(), and muni_sf() functions fix previous bugs`
# `UPDATE 2025-06-17: Two new sets of crosswalk tables added to address the one-to-many relationship between blockgroups/tracts and municipalities`


## `UPDATE: ACS 2016-20 Municipal GEOIDS added to mapcdatakeys::all_muni_data_keys() function`

This package contains two kinds of components:

### Data Keys

These data keys are created at the municipal, census block, block group
and tract level. As Census geographies can change between two decadal
counts, they have two kinds of crosswalks - geographical, and weighted.
For these, we provide two functions described below.

*Please raise an issue if you would like any additions, or alterations
to this package which we can incorporate.*

Detailed descriptions of each geographic level of data keys can be found
on their individual pages below:

-   [Municipal Level Keys](municipal_level_keys.md)

-   [Keys for Census Geographies](census_geog_keys.md)

### Functions to call crosswalks

These two functions are used to call specific crosswalks based on either
their vintage, and/or the relevant geographic unit.

-   [Crosswalk Functions](crosswalk_functions.md)

This package obtains standardized data keys for four different
geographic levels in Massachusetts.
